# xml_generator

Ruby script that automatically creates .xml file that meets the clients' specific schemas

- Using the recursive methods to iterate through multiple hashes. 

- Handling both the attribute and the text for each xml nodes.

As long as the namespaces or the hashses are properly defined, the `generate_xml()` method can flexibly handle multiple nested nodes with attributes and texts.
